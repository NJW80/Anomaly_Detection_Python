# Anomaly_Detection_Python
This code and dummy data is intended to demonstrate my level of Python programming only. Certain steps and specific logic have been removed or amended to protect the client and to avoid divulging sensitive information.

The project is currently a work in progress and is a replication of an anomaly detection project originally written in SAS.
